# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This project was completed as part of my training program. It's an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to play against another player or against the computer, with the computer making random moves.

   - **Two Players**: Two players can take turns clicking on the grid to place their X or O.
   - **Player vs. Computer**: Play against the computer, which makes random moves.

3. Start playing, taking turns with your opponent or facing the computer.

4. The first player to align 3 X's or O's vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
